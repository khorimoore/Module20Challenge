Setup and Installation



Prerequisites



Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:



	â€¢	Node.js

	â€¢	MongoDB (local or Atlas)

	â€¢	Render account

	â€¢	GitHub repository



Installation Steps



	1.	Clone the repository:



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/module-20-challenge.git

cd module-20-challenge





	2.	Install dependencies:



npm install





	3.	Configure environment variables:

	â€¢	Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:



MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri





	4.	Run the development server:



npm run dev







Usage



	1.	Create a branch and push your code.

	2.	Open a pull request to the develop branch.

	â€¢	GitHub Actions will automatically run Cypress tests.

	3.	Once approved, merge into the main branch.

	â€¢	This will trigger deployment to Render.
